## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned to organize a little the code to find quickly a property that  need to be changed later.

### Continued development

Try to write clean code, and keep working with flexbox, learn more ways to implement responsive design.
